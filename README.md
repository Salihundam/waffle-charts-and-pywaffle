# 📊 Waffle Chart Visualization using Python

This project demonstrates how to create a **Waffle Chart visualization** using Python to represent categorical proportions in a visually intuitive grid format. The chart is built using **Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy**, and visualizes immigration data for selected countries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

A waffle chart is a grid-based visualization where each tile represents a proportion of the total. This project:

- Loads immigration data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Filters data for specific countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden)
- Calculates proportional representation
- Converts proportions into tiles
- Displays a waffle chart using Matplotlib

This visualization makes it easier to compare categorical values visually.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains immigration data to Canada by country.
